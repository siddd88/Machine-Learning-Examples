k-means Clustering
==================

This is a simple pythonic implementation of the two centroid-based
partitioned clustering algorithms: *k-means* and *bisecting k-means*.

Requirements
------------

To run this program, you need to have python 3.x installed with
following packages:

- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these with the following command:

::

  $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Usage
-----

First of all, you need to have a data file. A sample data file ``data.txt``
is included in this repo. It contains 100 two-dimensional Cartesian points with
10 Gaussian clusters. The data can be visualized at ``data.pdf``.

Now you can run and test the two clustering algorithms. The sample result is
shown in ``result.pdf``.

Standard k-means
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For running the program on the sample dataset, run:
::

  $ python3 test_kmeans.py --verbose

To use your own datasets and change various clustering paramters, see help text.
::

  $ python3 test_kmeans.py --help

Bisecting k-means
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bisecting k-means internally uses the standard k-means with k=2.

For running the program on the sample dataset, run:
::

  $ python3 test_bisecting.py --verbose

To use your own datasets and change various clustering paramters, see help text.
::

  $ python3 test_bisecting.py --help
